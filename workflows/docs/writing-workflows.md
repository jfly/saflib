# Writing Workflows

Best practices notes. In flux.

- Templates
  - Should work
  - Should be structured like the expected structure.
  - Should pass type checks
  - Should include a stub or basic usage.
  - Should include tests.
  - Should be written for a process you've done at least a few times and refined at least somewhat.
  - Should be written while you're doing that process.
