# Function: runWorkflowCli()

> **runWorkflowCli**(`workflows`, `options`): `Promise`\<`void`\>

Given a list of workflow classes, runs a CLI for running workflows.

The @saflib/workflows package can't run the CLI because other packages
depend on it to make workflows. So a separate package needs to depend on
those packages which depend on @saflib/workflows. This export allows
a separate package to actually gather all the ConcreteWorkflowRunners and expose them as a CLI.

Use this also to customize which workflows are actually available.
