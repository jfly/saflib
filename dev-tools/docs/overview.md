# Overview

`@saflib/dev-tools` is a utility package, providing code and bin commands for working across a SAF project.

## Code

Provides utilities for getting information about the NPM workspace. The CLI tools this package provides are some of the main consumers of these utilities.

See [Code Reference](./ref/index.md) for more info.

## CLI

These are fairly disparate tools, their only theme being they apply to all sorts of packages. These tools may be split out into separate packages later.

See [CLI Reference](./cli/index.md) for more info.
