# Overview

`@saflib/commander` is a library for adding CLI commands to your package's `bin` field. It uses [commander](https://github.com/tj/commander.js#readme) under the hood.

Currently it's pretty lightweight, just providing a convenience function for providing `@saflib/node` context and reporters to your CLI commands.
