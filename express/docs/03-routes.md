# Routes

Routes are the main source of packages which depend on `@saflib/express`. They are strongly typed, using types generated by separate `spec` packages which depend on `@saflib/openapi`.

## File Organization

Routes should be organized in directories by their route prefix. For example [identity routes](https://github.com/sderickson/saflib/tree/f1864114bbd38b20996ea0dfe486767dff42d3b2/identity/identity-service/routes) are divided into `users` and `auth` folders based on their [OpenAPI-specified paths](https://github.com/sderickson/saflib/blob/f1864114bbd38b20996ea0dfe486767dff42d3b2/identity/identity-spec/openapi.yaml).

Each specific query operation (get, list, create, update, delete) should reside in its own file per [best practice](../../best-practices.md#keep-files-small). An `index.ts` file within each domain directory aggregates the individual query files.

## Typing

Spec packages provide types for requests and responses. Every handler must use these types to highlight as quickly as possible when the implementation does not match the specification.

Spec libraries export types which have lookups based on API operationIds and status codes that can be used to quickly access the types for that route. It is up to the route to use those types such as by assigning

## Implementation Basics

- Use `createHandler` for each route handler. It ensures asynchronous errors are caught and passed to the central error handling middleware.
- Each route handler should be in its own file within a feature-specific directory (e.g., `/routes/feature-name/`). See [Setup](./01-setup.md) for the recommended structure.
- Handlers within a feature directory should be combined using an Express `Router` in the feature's `index.ts`.
- Use types generated from your OpenAPI specification (e.g., `@your-org/{service-name}-spec`) for request bodies, path parameters, query parameters, and response bodies to ensure conformance.
- **Error Handling Philosophy:**
  - Route handlers should **handle expected errors** returned by service/database layers (e.g., "Not Found", "Validation Failed"). This typically involves checking the `error` property of the returned object (see `ReturnsError` pattern).
  - Handlers translate these expected errors into appropriate HTTP status codes and response bodies (conforming to the OpenAPI spec).
  - **For queries that currently never return errors, use a `switch (true)` with a `throw error satisfies never;` in the `default` case. This ensures TypeScript will catch unhandled error types if the DB/service layer ever starts returning them.**
  - **Unexpected errors** (database connection issues, bugs, errors _thrown_ by services) should _not_ be caught by `try/catch` in the handler. Let them propagate; `createHandler` will catch them and pass them to the central error middleware, typically resulting in a 500 response.
- Routes are primarily responsible for HTTP concerns: request validation (basic format), authorization checks, context extraction, calling service/DB layer, response formatting (mapping results/errors to HTTP status/body), and adhering to the API contract (OpenAPI spec).
- Note that openapi validation and auth middleware checks happen before, so routes should assume params, body, and auth are valid. A handler need never throw a 401, but they could throw 403s.
- Keep business logic out of route handlers; place it in separate library or database layer functions.

## Route Handler Structure

Each route handler should be in its own file (e.g., `routes/auth/login.ts`) and follow this pattern:

```typescript
import { createHandler } from "@saflib/express";
import { asyncLocalStorage } from "../../context.ts";
import type { ApiRequest, ApiResponse } from "@your-org/your-spec"; // Adjust spec import
import {
  UserNotFoundError,
  InvalidCredentialsError,
} from "@your-org/your-db-package"; // Adjust error imports
import createError from "http-errors"; // For creating standard HTTP errors

export const loginHandler = createHandler(async (req, res) => {
  // Get context
  const ctx = asyncLocalStorage.getStore()!;

  // Validate and type the request body according to the spec
  // Basic validation might happen here or in middleware
  const loginRequest: ApiRequest["loginUser"] = req.body;

  // Call the appropriate service/DB function
  const { result: user, error } = await ctx.db.user.authenticate(loginRequest);

  // Handle expected errors returned by the service/DB layer
  if (error) {
    switch (true) {
      case error instanceof UserNotFoundError:
      case error instanceof InvalidCredentialsError:
        throw createError(404);
      default:
        // If an unexpected error type was *returned* (should be rare),
        // throw it so the central error handler catches it.
        // This ensures all error types from the DB layer are handled.
        throw error satisfies never;
    }
  }

  // If successful, send a typed 200 response conforming to the spec
  const response: ApiResponse["loginUser"][200] = {
    user: { id: user.id, email: user.email /* ... other fields */ },
    token: "jwt.token.here", // Assuming token generation happens here or is returned by authenticate
  };
  res.status(200).json(response);
});
```

## Route Organization

Create a router file within each feature directory (e.g., `routes/auth/index.ts`) to combine handlers for that feature:

```typescript
// routes/auth/index.ts
import express from "express";
import { loginHandler } from "./login.ts";
import { registerHandler } from "./register.ts";
// Import other auth handlers...

const router = express.Router();

// Define routes for the auth feature
router.post("/login", loginHandler);
router.post("/register", registerHandler);
// Add other auth routes...

export { router as authRouter };
```

Mount these feature routers in the main app file (`http.ts`), as shown in [Setup](./01-setup.md).

## Error Handling Examples

The `createHandler` wrapper simplifies error handling by catching unhandled promise rejections and thrown errors.

**Handling Expected Errors (Returned by Service/DB):**

```typescript
import { createHandler } from "@saflib/express";
import { asyncLocalStorage } from "../../context.ts";
import type { ApiRequest, ApiResponse } from "@your-org/your-spec";
import { CallSeriesNotFoundError } from "@your-org/your-db-package";
import createError from "http-errors";

export const getCallSeriesHandler = createHandler(async (req, res) => {
  const ctx = asyncLocalStorage.getStore()!;
  const { auth } = getSafContextWithAuth();
  const callSeriesId = parseInt(req.params.id);

  const { result: callSeries, error } =
    await ctx.db.callSeries.get(callSeriesId);

  if (error) {
    switch (true) {
      case error instanceof CallSeriesNotFoundError:
        throw createError(404);
      default:
        // If an unexpected error type was *returned* (should be rare),
        // throw it so the central error handler catches it.
        // This ensures all error types from the DB layer are handled.
        throw error satisfies never;
    }
  }

  // Check Authorization (Example)
  if (callSeries.ownerId !== auth.userId) {
    throw createError(403);
  }

  const response: ApiResponse["getCallSeries"][200] = {
    call_series: {
      /* map db result to api spec */
    },
  };
  res.status(200).json(response);
});
```

**For queries that currently never return errors:**

```typescript
const { result, error } = await mainDb.contacts.create(ctx.dbKey, input);
if (error) {
  switch (true) {
    default:
      throw error satisfies never;
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

1.  **HTTP Focus:** Handlers manage HTTP request/response lifecycle.
2.  **Separate Business Logic:** Place core logic in service/DB layers.
3.  **Use OpenAPI Types:** Ensure handlers conform to the API contract.
    - Type request bodies, parameters, and responses using generated types.
    - Adhere to specified success and error response schemas.
4.  **Error Handling:** Handle _expected_ errors returned from services by mapping them to appropriate HTTP responses. Let _unexpected_ errors (thrown) propagate to the central error handler via `createHandler`.
5.  **File Structure:** Follow the "one handler per file" structure within feature directories.
