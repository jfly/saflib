## Functions

| Function                                              | Description                                                                                                                                    |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [resolveGrpcRequest](functions/resolveGrpcRequest.md) | Resolves a gRPC request, waiting for the server to start and checking that the request was successful. Moves fake timers forward if necessary. |
| [runTestServer](functions/runTestServer.md)           | Runs a gRPC server for testing. Handles if fake timers are in use (which tends to break the server).                                           |
