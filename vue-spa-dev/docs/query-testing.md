# Testing TanStack Query Integration

This guide focuses on how to effectively test your TanStack Query integration in a SAF-powered Vue SPA. The emphasis is on integration and cache behaviorâ€”testing how queries and mutations interact, how cache is invalidated, and how the UI responds to real-world usage patterns. For reference, see the comprehensive integration tests in `call-series.test.ts` and `schedule-rule.test.ts`.

## Testing Setup

To test TanStack Query integration, set up a proper environment using the `withVueQuery` helper from `@saflib/vue-spa-dev/requests.js`. This provides a QueryClient and a Vue app context for your tests.

```typescript
import { withVueQuery } from "@saflib/vue-spa-dev/requests.js";

const [mutation, app, queryClient] = withVueQuery(() => useCreateFeature());
const [query] = withVueQuery(() => useQuery(getFeature()));
```

Always unmount the app after each test:

```typescript
app.unmount();
```

## Integration Test Patterns

### Testing Query/Mutation Interactions

The most valuable tests are those that simulate real user flows: create, update, and delete operations, and how they affect the cache and UI. For example:

```typescript
// call-series.test.ts
it("should create a call series and invalidate queries", async () => {
  const [createMutation, app, queryClient] = withVueQuery(() =>
    useCreateCallSeries(),
  );
  const [query] = withVueQuery(() => useQuery(getCallSeries()));

  // Initial fetch
  await query.refetch();
  expect(query.data.value?.call_series).toHaveLength(2);

  // Create new call series
  await createMutation.mutateAsync({
    /* ... */
  });

  // Cache should be invalidated
  const cachedData = queryClient.getQueryData(["call-series"]);
  expect(cachedData).toBeUndefined();

  app.unmount();
});
```

### Testing Cache Invalidation

Test that mutations properly invalidate or remove cached queries, and that subsequent queries refetch as expected.

```typescript
// schedule-rule.test.ts
it("should update a schedule rule and invalidate queries", async () => {
  const [updateMutation, app, queryClient] = withVueQuery(() =>
    useUpdateScheduleRule(),
  );
  const [query] = withVueQuery(() =>
    useQuery({
      queryKey: ["call-series", 1],
      queryFn: async () => ({
        /* ... */
      }),
    }),
  );

  await query.refetch();
  expect(query.data.value?.call_series).toBeDefined();

  await updateMutation.mutateAsync({
    /* ... */
  });

  // Cache should be invalidated
  const cachedData = queryClient.getQueryData(["call-series", 1]);
  expect(cachedData).toBeUndefined();

  app.unmount();
});
```

### Testing Refetching and State

Test that after cache invalidation, queries refetch and the UI state updates accordingly. You can also test error states and loading indicators by mocking network responses.

## Best Practices

- **Test at the integration level:** Focus on how queries and mutations interact, not just isolated query logic.
- **Use real cache keys:** Always use the same query keys as your app to ensure cache invalidation works as expected.
- **Check cache state:** Use `queryClient.getQueryData` to assert cache presence or absence after mutations.
- **Simulate user flows:** Chain queries and mutations in your tests to mimic real usage.
- **Always unmount:** Clean up the Vue app after each test to avoid memory leaks.
